        As I reflect on my first year, I can't help but share my excitement
        about the things that truly captivate me. I have a genuine interest in
        the intricate world of data analysis and software maintenance. There's
        something incredibly fulfilling about unraveling complex data puzzles
        and ensuring that software systems run smoothly, especially in the
        global context of an international company. During my downtime, I find
        joy in activities like coding and tackling data analysis challenges,
        honing the skills I know will be crucial in my chosen field.
